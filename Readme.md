<h3><b>About BraveCom</b></h3>
<p>
  Need to connect arises, a platform is essential for people  to support and help each other by sharing their feelings and communicating with others who are also facing similar situations and aid each other in the best possible manner. 
<br><br>
We believe that spreading awareness about mental health is extremely important and through the website, people will get informed about their rights and duties.
<br><br>
We also believe in neighbourhood volunteering which is essentially stepping forward, when need be, to help in whatever way benefits the society. These volunteering tasks are very closeby to where the person viewing lives, hence solving the problem of travel during COVID-19
